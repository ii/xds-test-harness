Feature: Subscribing to Resources
  Client can do wildcard subscriptions or normal subscriptions
  and receive updates when any subscribed resources change.

  These features come from this list of test cases:

  Scenario Outline: [<service>] The service should send all resources on a wildcard request.
    Given a target setup with service <service>, resources <resources>, and starting version <starting version>
    When the Client does a wildcard subscription to <service>
    Then the Client receives the resources <expected resources> and version <starting version> for <service>
    And the Client sends an ACK to which the <service> does not respond

    Examples:
      | service | starting version | resources | expected resources |
      | "CDS"   | "1"              | "A,B,C"   | "C,A,B"            |
      | "LDS"   | "1"              | "D,E,F"   | "F,D,E"            |

  Scenario Outline: [<service>] The service should send updates to the client
    Given a target setup with service <service>, resources <resources>, and starting version <starting version>
    When the Client does a wildcard subscription to <service>
    Then the Client receives the resources <expected resources> and version <starting version> for <service>
    When  the resources <chosen resource> of the <service> is updated to version <next version>
    Then the Client receives the resources <expected resources> and version <next version> for <service>
    And the Client sends an ACK to which the <service> does not respond

    Examples:
      | service | starting version | next version | resources | expected resources | chosen resource |
      | "CDS"   | "1"              | "2"          | "A,B,C"   | "A,B,C"            | "A"             |
      | "LDS"   | "1"              | "2"          | "D,E,F"   | "D,E,F"            | "D"             |


  @sotw @non-aggregated @aggregated
  Scenario Outline: [<service>] Wildcard subscriptions receive updates when new resources are added
    Given a target setup with service <service>, resources <resources>, and starting version <starting version>
    When the Client does a wildcard subscription to <service>
    Then the Client receives the resources <resources> and version <starting version> for <service>
    When the resource <new resource> is added to the <service> with version <next version>
    Then the Client receives the resources <expected resources> and version <next version> for <service>
    And the Client sends an ACK to which the <service> does not respond

    Examples:
      | service | starting version | resources | new resource | expected resources | next version |
      | "CDS"   | "1"              | "A,B,C"   | "D"          | "A,B,C,D"          | "2"          |
      | "LDS"   | "1"              | "D,E,F"   | "G"          | "D,E,F,G"          | "2"          |


  @sotw @non-aggregated @aggregated
  Scenario: [<service>]  When subscribing to specific resources, receive only these resources
    Given a target setup with service <service>, resources <resources>, and starting version <starting version>
    When the Client subscribes to resources <subset of resources> for <service>
    Then the Client receives the resources <subset of resources> and version <starting version> for <service>
    And the Client sends an ACK to which the <service> does not respond

    Examples:
      | service | starting version | resources | subset of resources |
      | "CDS"   | "1"              | "A,B,C,D" | "B,D"               |
      | "LDS"   | "1"              | "G,B,L,D" | "L,G"               |
      | "RDS"   | "1"              | "A,B"     | "A,B"               |
      | "EDS"   | "1"              | "A,B"     | "A,B"               |

  Scenario: [<service>] When subscribing to specific resources, receive response when those resources change
    Given a target setup with service <service>, resources <resources>, and starting version <starting version>
    When the Client subscribes to resources <subset of resources> for <service>
    Then the Client receives the resources <subset of resources> and version <starting version> for <service>
    When the resources <subscribed resource> of the <service> is updated to version <next version>
    Then the Client receives the resources <subset of resources> and version <next version> for <service>
    And the Client sends an ACK to which the <service> does not respond

    Examples:
      | service | starting version | resources   | subset of resources | subscribed resource | next version |
      | "CDS"   | "1"              | "A,B,C,D"   | "B,D"               | "B"                 | "2"          |
      | "LDS"   | "1"              | "G,B,L,D"   | "L,G"               | "G"                 | "2"          |
