# Tester Prototype

This is an exploratory repo whose code is a strong work-in-progress. It is
intended to build understanding on how to communicate with xDS servers and clients. 

At the moment, it is a client expected to send a discovery request to the [go control plane example server](https://github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane/blob/main/internal/example/README.md) and get a discovery response.
